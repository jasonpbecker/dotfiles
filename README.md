## TODO

- [x] Write intial make file to setup symlinks.
- [x] Rearrange vim and zsh and make sure they're complete for symlink script to be easiest.
- [X] Add shell color scheme settings (.terminal file for OSX, not sure for Linux).
- [x] Research updating symlinks so that an alternative make file or script can be used to keep multiple machines up-to-date.
- [X] Figure out what has to be done to install Vundle first, considering vim now hanldes Vundle itself.
- [x] Add Homebrew and Homebrew installs for OSX
- [ ] Add apt-get installs for Linux.

- [ ] Add gitconfig
- [ ] User install2.r or similar to install R packages I always want.
- [ ] Break up bootstrap.sh into more parts.
- [ ] Figure out why ln -sF and ln -sf don't work for vim => ~/.vim
